# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is an **AI agent configuration repository** containing:
- Core agent workflow instructions (AGENTS.md)
- Custom Claude Code slash commands for development workflows
- Specialized agent role definitions (implementer, review-architect)
- Language-specific development guidelines (Ruby/Rails, JavaScript, Testing, Git)

This repository is designed to be referenced globally via `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` or copied into individual projects to guide AI coding assistants.

## Private / Company-Specific Files

Some files are **gitignored** because they contain company-specific or team-specific information. These files live on disk locally and are still picked up by Claude Code when symlinked, but they are not committed to version control.

### `teammates.md` (gitignored)

A reference file that maps teammate names to their GitHub usernames, organized by team. This allows AI agents to correctly assign PR reviewers, mention teammates in issues, and interact with GitHub on your behalf without needing exact usernames. Each entry includes the person's full name, GitHub username, and common name aliases for fuzzy matching (e.g., nicknames, shortened names).

### `shared-rules/<company>-*.md` (gitignored)

Company-specific shared rules containing proprietary conventions, internal tooling commands, or codebase-specific patterns. These follow the same format as the public shared rules but cover things like internal CLI aliases, company-specific migration conventions, custom framework patterns, and internal spec helper conventions.

## Development Workflows

This repository does not have traditional "build" or "test" commands since it contains markdown documentation and configuration files. However, the content defines complete development workflows for other projects.

### Working with This Repository

**To modify agent configurations:**
1. Edit relevant `.md` files in `agents/`, `commands/`, or `shared-rules/`
2. Test changes by using the commands/agents in actual projects
3. Commit changes following git-workflow guidelines

**To test setup automation:**
1. Run `rake setup` to verify symlinking works correctly
2. Check `~/.claude/` directory for proper symlinks
3. Run `rake uninstall` to verify cleanup works
4. Ensure only repo-owned symlinks are removed

**To add a new slash command:**
1. Create a new `.md` file in `commands/` directory
2. Include frontmatter with `description` and `allowed-tools`
3. Write clear, step-by-step instructions for the agent
4. Update `commands/README.md` with documentation
5. Test the command in a real project

**To add a new guideline:**
1. Create a new `.md` file in `shared-rules/` directory
2. Document language/framework-specific conventions
3. Update `AGENTS.md` to reference the new guideline
4. Include examples and anti-patterns

### Slash Command Architecture

All slash commands follow a consistent structure:

```markdown
---
description: Brief description (shown in command list)
allowed-tools: Bash, Read, Edit, Write, Task, SlashCommand
---

[Agent instructions that execute when command is invoked]
```

**Key command patterns:**

1. **Workflow Commands** (`/task-orchestrator`, `/process-task-list`):
   - Read task list files from `tasks/` directory
   - Use Task tool to spawn specialized agents
   - Update task completion status (`[ ]` → `[x]`)
   - Pause for user approval between steps

2. **Git Commands** (`/smart-commit`, `/create-pr`):
   - Analyze git state
   - Follow branch naming: `<TICKET>-claude-<feature>` or `claude-<feature>`
   - Enforce proper workflows (never commit to main)

## Specialized Agent Roles

### Implementer Agent (agents/implementer.md)

**Purpose:** Execute implementation tasks with precision, following specifications exactly.

**Key principles:**
- Follow task description exactly (no scope creep)
- Do not refactor unless explicitly required
- Implement minimal changes focused on the task
- Report completion with clear summary

**Used by:** `/task-orchestrator` command

### Review Architect Agent (agents/review-architect.md)

**Purpose:** Provide critical code review and quality assurance.

**Key principles:**
- Review with fresh perspective
- Check correctness, quality, edge cases
- Provide constructive, actionable feedback
- Make recommendation: APPROVE / REQUEST CHANGES / NEEDS DISCUSSION

**Used by:** `/task-orchestrator` command

## Important Conventions

### Branch Naming
- **With ticket:** `<TICKET>-<agent-name>-<feature>` (e.g., `MDZ-10-claude-user-auth`)
- **Without ticket:** `<agent-name>-<feature>` (e.g., `claude-refactor-orders`)
- Check context for Linear/Jira ticket references

### Commit Messages
- Use imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Do NOT use prefixes like "feat:", "fix:", "chore:"
- Be descriptive and explain "what" and "why"
- Reference ticket numbers when applicable

### Task List Format
Tasks are stored in `tasks/` directory as markdown with this structure:

```markdown
## Relevant Files
- `path/to/file.rb` - Description of what this file does

## Tasks
- [ ] 1.0 Parent Task
  - [ ] 1.1 Subtask description
  - [ ] 1.2 Subtask description
- [ ] 2.0 Another Parent Task
  - [ ] 2.1 Subtask description
```

Mark completed tasks with `[x]`.

### Directory Structure for Generated Files
- `tasks/brainstorm-*.md` - Output from `/brainstorm`
- `tasks/tasks-*.md` - Task breakdowns from `/generate-tasks`

## Integration with Other Projects

This repository is designed to be referenced globally or copied into projects:

### Global Setup

**Automated (Recommended):**
```bash
cd <path-to-claude-config>
rake setup
```

**Manual (Alternative):**
Add to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`:

```markdown
For all projects, follow the guidelines in <path-to-claude-config>/AGENTS.md

When working on specific technologies, reference:
- Ruby/Rails: <path-to-claude-config>/shared-rules/ruby-rails.md
- JavaScript: <path-to-claude-config>/shared-rules/javascript.md
- Testing: <path-to-claude-config>/shared-rules/testing.md
- Git workflow: <path-to-claude-config>/shared-rules/git-workflow.md
```

### Project-Specific Setup
Copy relevant files to `.claude/` in project directory:

```bash
# Copy all commands
cp -r <path-to-claude-config>/commands /path/to/project/.claude/

# Copy agents
cp -r <path-to-claude-config>/agents /path/to/project/.claude/

# Copy AGENTS.md to project root
cp <path-to-claude-config>/AGENTS.md /path/to/project/
```

## Testing Changes

Since this is a configuration/documentation repository, "testing" means:

1. **Validate markdown syntax:** Ensure files render correctly
2. **Test commands in real projects:** Use slash commands in actual development
3. **Verify agent behavior:** Check that implementer/review-architect work as intended
4. **Validate workflows:** Run through complete workflows (brainstorm → tasks → implementation)
5. **Test Rakefile tasks:** Verify `rake setup` and `rake uninstall` work correctly

## Common Patterns

### When Modifying Commands

1. **Read the existing command** to understand structure
2. **Follow the frontmatter format** (description + allowed-tools)
3. **Use clear, imperative instructions** for the agent
4. **Include examples** of expected behavior
5. **Reference other guidelines** when appropriate (e.g., link to AGENTS.md)
6. **Test in a real project** before committing

### When Updating Guidelines

1. **Keep it focused** - One language/framework per file
2. **Include examples** - Show good and bad patterns
3. **Be explicit** - Don't assume agents know conventions
4. **Update AGENTS.md** - Add reference links if needed
5. **Test with actual code** - Verify guidelines work in practice

## Architecture Notes

### Command Execution Flow

1. User types `/command-name` in Claude Code
2. Claude reads `commands/command-name.md`
3. Frontmatter defines allowed tools
4. Agent follows instructions in command file
5. Agent may spawn sub-agents using Task tool
6. Results presented to user

### Agent Spawning Pattern (Task Orchestrator)

```
Task Orchestrator (main agent)
  ↓
  ├─ Spawns Implementer Agent (via Task tool)
  │  └─ Reads agents/implementer.md
  │  └─ Executes task
  │  └─ Returns completion report
  ↓
  ├─ Spawns Review Architect Agent (via Task tool)
  │  └─ Reads agents/review-architect.md
  │  └─ Reviews implementation
  │  └─ Returns review feedback
  ↓
  └─ Presents results to user and waits for approval
```

### Workflow Orchestration

Large features follow this pattern:

```
Idea (vague)
  ↓ /brainstorm
Clear Idea
  ↓ /generate-tasks
Task List
  ↓ /task-orchestrator (AI) or /process-task-list (manual)
Implementation
  ↓ /smart-commit (automated)
Commits
  ↓ /create-pr
Pull Request
  ↓ (merge on GitHub)
Done
```

## Design Philosophy

This repository embodies several key principles:

1. **Systematic over ad-hoc:** Workflows are structured and repeatable
2. **Human oversight:** AI agents pause for approval (never fully autonomous)
3. **Separation of concerns:** Implementer focuses on execution, architect on review
4. **Documentation-driven:** Requirements → Tasks → Implementation
5. **Convention over configuration:** Strong conventions reduce decisions
6. **Minimal but complete:** Include what's needed, nothing more

## Maintenance Notes

**When adding new commands:**
- Place in `commands/` directory
- Update main `README.md` if it significantly changes workflows

**When updating agent roles:**
- Edit `agents/implementer.md` or `agents/review-architect.md`
- Test with `/task-orchestrator` to verify changes work
- Update `commands/task-orchestrator.md` if interface changes

**When updating guidelines:**
- Edit relevant file in `shared-rules/`
- Ensure `AGENTS.md` references are up to date
- Test by using guidelines in real projects
